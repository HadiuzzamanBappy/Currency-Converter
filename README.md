## API Integration

This project relies on a third-party currency exchange rate API.

* **API Provider:** [Mention the specific API you are using, e.g., ExchangeRate-API, Open Exchange Rates, Fixer, etc.]
* **API Endpoint:** `[Provide the base URL of the API endpoint you are using for exchange rates]`
* **API Key:** You may need an API key for the chosen service. If so, **do not commit your API key directly into your public repository.** Instead, consider using environment variables or a proxy server for production, or a placeholder for development.
    * **For Development:** For local development, you might temporarily place your API key in your JavaScript file, but remember to remove it before pushing to a public repository. A common approach is to have a `config.js` (excluded from gitignore) or similar.

    *Example JavaScript (simplified):*
    ```javascript
    // In your script.js or api.js file
    const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'; // Replace with your actual API key
    const API_BASE_URL = '[https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/](https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/)'; // Example
    ```
    Please refer to the chosen API's documentation for details on obtaining and using your API key.
